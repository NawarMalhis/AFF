# AFF
Annotated fasta format

The Annotated FASTA Format (AFF), with a .af file extension, is a text-based format for protein amino acid sequences that includes multiple annotation tags and a statistical summary header. This AFF Python library provides tools for reading, writing, and processing .af files, as well as reading residue-level scores, generating ROC and precision-recall plots, and calculating metrics such as AUC, average precision score (APS), and success rate.
